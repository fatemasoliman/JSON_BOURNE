E-commerce has made business more viable and profitable, and as a result, several new e-commerce businesses are starting every day.  Among the advantages of e-commerce are lower costs (including marketing cost), possibility of retargeting customers, and the ability to easily promote and ship products worldwide.

On average, an e-commerce website has a conversion rate of 2% - 3%. Our team seeks to increase conversion rate by improving marketing strategies, using analysis and machine learning tools, for the Google Merchandise Store - a website that sells Google branded merchandise and ships worldwide.
